Triangles, triangles.....

A meshing and searching program in C++.

The (very fast) triangulation is built with the delaunator-\/cpp\+: \href{https://github.com/delfrrr/delaunator-cpp}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/delfrrr/delaunator-\/cpp}}. For any set of scatter coordinates in 2D, a mesh objects triangulates the domain, and then \char`\"{}walks\char`\"{} on the triangulation\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You want to locate point P in the triangulation.
\item Start from any triangle t, find point P0 that\textquotesingle{}s in t. (centroid, for example)
\item Connect P and P0. Find the edge e in t that P-\/\+P0 intersects with
\item Walk to the other triangle that shares e with t
\item Repeat.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Since the consecutive calls to the \char`\"{}search\char`\"{} is likely to be correlated, it is recommended to use the result of previous search as the initial guess for the next. The complexity of the search is then amortized O(1), worst case O(\+N), where N is the number of scattered coordinates.

Interpolations are done with barycentric linear interpolations in triangles.

Example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{typedef std::vector<double> VecDoub;}
\DoxyCodeLine{// coordinates in format required by delaunator \{x1, y1, x2, y2, ...\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{VecDoub coords = \{-\/1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -\/1, -\/1, -\/1, 0, 0, -\/1, 0\};}
\DoxyCodeLine{// function values (to be interpolated) defined on vertices}
\DoxyCodeLine{VecDoub val = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Mesh mesh(coords, val);}
\DoxyCodeLine{// example point to search for}
\DoxyCodeLine{MeshPoint p(0.5, 0.8);}
\DoxyCodeLine{// initial guess for the index of triangle}
\DoxyCodeLine{size\_t start = 0;}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::vector<size\_t> tout = mesh.search(p, start);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// The last item in the search history is the final result}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::vector<MeshPoint> t\_coords = mesh.coordsOfTriag(tout.back());}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::cout << "Found in triangle " << tout.back() << std::endl;}
\DoxyCodeLine{for (int i=0; i< t\_coords.size(); i++)\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    std::cout << t\_coords[i].x\_ << "," << t\_coords[i].y\_ << std::endl;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}
